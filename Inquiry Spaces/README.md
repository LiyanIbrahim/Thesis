Random notes from the spaces exercise: </br>
Thinking about how the “White noise of upbringing”   </br>
Reflections of being a Palestinian in diaspora  </br>
Want it to bridge physical and virtual even though most of my work is mostly virtual  </br>
I know I want it to be immersive but I don’t know if I want it to be interactive  </br>

Some influences:  </br>
<b>Lawrence Abu Hamdan’s</b> work uses various kinds of audio to explore its effects on human rights and law. </br>
<b>Mahmoud Darwish’s poetry</b> on the Palestinian experience  </br>
<b>Resident Elyana’s</b> thesis :)  </br></br>

Some writings that inspire my thoughts </br>
“His (Ghassan Kanafani) “work” was survival, both his own and that of his people, the Palestinians”. 
</br></br>
“Borders and barriers, which enclose us within the safety of familiar territory, can also become prisons, and are often defended beyond reason or necessity. Exiles cross borders, break barriers of thought and experience.”
</br></br>
“Much of the exile’s life is taken up with compensating for disorienting loss by creating a new world to rule… Seeing “the entire world as a foreign land” makes possible originality of vision.”
