Random notes from the spaces exercise: </br>
Thinking about how the “White noise of upbringing”   </br>
Reflections of being a Palestinian in diaspora  </br>
Want it to bridge physical and virtual even though most of my work is mostly virtual  </br>
I know I want it to be immersive but I don’t know if I want it to be interactive  </br>
 </br> </br>
Some influences:  </br>
<b>Lawrence Abu Hamdan’s</b> work uses various kinds of audio to explore its effects on human rights and law. </br>
<b>Mahmoud Darwish’s poetry</b> on the Palestinian experience  </br>
<b>Resident Elyana’s</b> thesis :)  </br>
