I got a bunch of useful feedback during user-testing but now my main dilemma is using a flashlight or not. To me, it feels like if I use a flashlight then I wouldn’t be able to projection map the shadow that I wanted to do and that means I’ll have to fit it somewhere else because I still want to do it. 
</br>
To kick off my production, I identified what I need to do for each of my two pieces but I started working on one of the pieces that I used in the user testing. I categorize in, simple words or sentences, what I want my thesis to be about/the feelings I want to provoke. After that, I put down what category each of these writings falls under. After doing that I decided to do more writing and I’m still trying to decide which ones to go with. For hardware/physical production of it, I got feedback that it would feel more personal if the notes were handwritten but I don’t know how I feel about that because I feel like it would feel incomplete for me. I also wanted it to have a typewriter feel to my writings and handwriting would not give that.

For the projection mapping vs flashlight: </br>
<li> Reasons people liked flashlight: </br>

  <ol>Flashlight is less distracting than shadows</ol>
<ol> Flashlight to guide in your own pace</ol>
<o> Feels like a secret corner / feels more intimate when you have light over something </o>
</li>
<li> Reasons I want projection mapping:
  <ol>Feels more interactive and more engaging  </ol>
  <o>Add an extra element to the storytelling   </o>
  <o>There is a graffiti stencil mural in the West Bank that is a girl flying with a balloon that is similar in style to what I wanted to make and so I was thinking of playing with that (In its original context, the artwork is thought to refer to the Palestinian right to freedom of movement)  
 </o>
</li>
</br> 

Maybe there is a way to include both in that one piece or move the projection element to the second piece. 
The second piece is a little more up in the air but I do what it to have a cocoon like structure and I’m meeting with phil to discuss my options here
