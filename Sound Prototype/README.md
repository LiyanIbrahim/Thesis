For this progress report, I actually did feel kind of stuck with moving forward with installation work. I feel as if I have a strong idea and a strong metaphor to use but I can’t really do it justice and it feels like an entire beast to tackle and without a vision of a starting point, I’m not really sure what to do with it. 
We discussed audio and sound before and that is definitely something I want to consider, if not independently then definitely media that considers sound. So I spent this time gathering  and editing sound files from pre-existing media such as the news but also recording different elements of stuff that I would maybe want to use.
