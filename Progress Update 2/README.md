<b>Research: </b> </br>
I've spent the past couple of weeks gathering resources and meeting with people and trying to narrow down ideas and inspirations of my thesis topic.  </br>
I knew what I wanted to discuss was the diasporic experience and communities but I had some reservations about tackling this productively for the following reasons:  </br>
1. I would say that at this moment in time and history and what is going on in the levant, i find that a lot of work and art on this topic very cringe and doesnt hit the spot  </br>
2. I also think that there is a lot of work on this topic and I want to be able to find an edge or something different in what I’m saying. Maybe the gulf diaspora experience  </br>
3. Collective memory: A big part of the diasporic experience is collective memory, which makes it feel like the stories and the genocide is something that is also mine (or experiencing it first hard) but it’s not and it would be unfair to group myself like that and hence I really want to be careful with this. 
 </br> </br>
After having multiple conversations and workshopping these thoughts, I think I want my thesis to explore the concept of being a palestinian spectator during the 2023/2024 genocide.

<b>Experiments: </b></br>
After figuring out the general direction of the content of my thesis. I’m starting to think about and this includes the experiments I want to plan, the form and generally what I want my thesis to look like. My initial thoughts is that I want it to have some sort of physical form and so I set up sometime this week to talk with performing artists and workshop what diasporic experiences can look like when there is a physical element of movement involved. 
Another experiment that was suggested to me is to gather different media forms daily and put them in folders in order to create something with them (short movie etc etc) and get people’s reaction to the different combinations of form and content.
