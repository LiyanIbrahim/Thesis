I plan on presenting two videos: one that will be projected on the wall and one that will play from my computer screen. I plan to have them similar in style/ aesthetic. The first video (projected) will have typing audio to indicate some kind of distance from the images and videos playing. The second video however, will have audio playing. I’m hoping that the kind of setup will add the dichotomy of the privilege of switching in and out of receiving and consuming this news but also in and out of actively thinking about that part of your identity that is a walking political tool and being actively aware of that.

I’m also layering some stuff from the book: The subjectively atlas of palestine  </br>
